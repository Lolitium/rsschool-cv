- ## ***About me:***
        I love math, books, logic tasks, writing code that will work (eventually).
        
        I had programming experience at university, but then it didn't become my profession.
        
        After 6 years, I actually start over, considering that in my work I used just Microsoft Office and 1C:Accounting.
        
        Among my strong qualities, I would single out abstract thinking, analytical mindset, perseverance and patience in solving problems.
